# Gaze-Cueing

This repository contains all of the data, scripts, and output* used for analyses in the paper "An Evidence Accumulation Account of the Gaze Cueing Effect: A Computational Modelling Investigation", by Alister, McKay, Sewell, and Evans. 

*some of the ouptu was too large for github but is available on the OSF. 
## Folder key: 

Archive: old scripts that are no longer relevant 

Data: all of the raw, clean, and derived data pertaining to each of the datasets including the code used to clean the raw data 

Descriptives: scripts for calculating descriptive statistics reported in the manuscript including the gaze cueing magnitudes, and standardised mean change scores.

Hierarchical modelling: scripts for running the hierarchical model and the hierarchical model anlayses. 

Manuscript figures: scripts for creating all of the figures in the manuscript and the corresponding figures themselves.

Modelling: scripts for running the individual-level models and the individual-level modelling anlayses. 

Recovery: scripts for running the recovery analysis.

Exploritory analyses: scripts for calculating the corrleations between datasets reported in the manuscript.
