# Gaze-Cueing

This repository contains all of the data, scripts, and output* used for analyses in the paper "An Evidence Accumulation Account of the Gaze Cueing Effect: A Computational Modelling Investigation", by Alister, McKay, Sewell, and Evans. 

Some of the output may not be exactly the same as that which is reported in the manuscript as they were recently reproduced and each iteration will produce slightly different results, but the conclusions remain the same. 

*some of the output was too large for GitHub but is available on the OSF. 

## Folder/File key: 

01.download-packages: will download all of the packages necessary to run this script

find-replace.command: if you have a mac, just replace all instances of <YOUR/DIRECTORY> with with the path to your working directory in order to run the scripts in this project. I'm unsure whether this will work on other operating systems, but I'm sure a similar command would exist that works in a similar way or you can just change the working directories manually. 

Archive: old scripts that are no longer relevant 

Data: all of the raw, clean, and derived data pertaining to each of the datasets including the code used to clean the raw data 

Descriptives: scripts for calculating descriptive statistics reported in the manuscript including the gaze cueing magnitudes, and standardised mean change scores.

Hierarchical modelling: scripts for running the hierarchical model and the hierarchical model analyses. 

Manuscript figures: scripts for creating all of the figures in the manuscript and the corresponding figures themselves.

Modelling: scripts for running the individual-level models and the individual-level modelling analyses. 

Recovery: scripts for running the recovery analysis.

Exploratory analyses: scripts for calculating the correlation between datasets reported in the manuscript.
