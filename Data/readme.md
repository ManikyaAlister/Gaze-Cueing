## Subfolder key: 

raw - raw data provided by the original authors

- clean: cleaned data used for analyses including the *cleaning script*  
     - rm-accuracy: participants excluded due to accuracy exclusion criteria  
     - rm-error: participants flagged by original authors as having an "error" in data collection  

- derived: derived data including key results from analyses such as AIC and BIC raw values and weights, quantiles of response time distributions for model fits, and a data set (and the script for creating it) containing the cueing magnitude, mean parameter estimates, and model probabilities for each participant. 

- model-predictions: model predictions of the individual-level models used to calculate model fits. 

- hier-model-predictions: same as above but for hierarchical analyses
